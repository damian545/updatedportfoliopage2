          Hello, my name is Damian Tapp. I'm 46 years old and I'm studying to be
          a web designer at Adelaide University at the moment. I have completed
          a lot of things for the first time during this course, many of which I
          am very proud of. Seeing as I have only started to use code for the
          first time at the end of 2019 leading up to this course. I am a very
          hard working person, I love finding out how things work, whether it is
          during Uni or with the hobbies that I do. I really want to change my
          job into a career. I have been working hard to learn what it takes to
          be a web designer, so I can fulfill my dream of change. I believe that
          my current job will fade away and getting into technology based work
          is here to stay, I want be a part of it. After spending 27 years in
          one job with little to no achievements, has effected me some what. I
          would love to be in an industry that has achievements and something to
          be proud of at the end of the day. I love to create, this is why I
          have some many hobbies and why I should be a programmer.
